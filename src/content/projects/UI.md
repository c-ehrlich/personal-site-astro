title: UI Components
description: Back to basics, just HTML and CSS. While learning clothesmaking I found that the best way to improve was to find great clothes and create replicas of them, in order to learn about the patterns and design systems that went into them. Now I am tuning my UI/UX skills by recreating my own versions of components that I like in other apps.
