## Hi :^)

I’m passionate about building performant, data-heavy apps, building best-in-class SDKs, leveling up developer experience, and helping teams ship fast. Recently I've also gotten into [pushing the limits](https://x.com/gdb/status/2021272681237361027) of what is possible with coding agents.

Right now I work remotely as a software engineer for [Axiom](https://axiom.co/). Before that I spent some time at [Moody’s Analytics](https://www.moodys.com/). In my spare time, I contribute to open-source projects (You might know me as a maintainer of [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) and contributor to [tRPC](https://trpc.io/).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://x.com/ccccjjjjeeee), [GitHub](https://github.com/ccccjjjjeeee), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ccccjjjjeeee/), or [book a call](https://cal.com/ccccjjjjeeee) with me.

You can also send me an email at [my last name] dot [my first name] at gmail dot com. I always appreciate hearing from you.

### Recent side projects (past year or so)

* 🌆 [micropolis](https://github.com/c-ehrlich/micropolis) - SimCity (1989) ported to TypeScript, running in the browser.
* ⚡️ [trace-amp](https://github.com/c-ehrlich/trace-amp) - OpenTelemetry tracing wrapper for Amp
* 🎥 [youtube-summarize-extension](https://github.com/c-ehrlich/youtube-summarize-extension) - Summarize YouTube videos to avoid clickbait. This used to work, but YouTube started restricting the closed captions API so no longer does.
* ⌨️ [cjode](https://github.com/c-ehrlich/cjode) - Coding agent similar to Amp (but much worse). The basic agent + subagents work, CLI works, don't expect it to perform anywhere near SOTA. I mostly just built this to better understand how existing agents work.
