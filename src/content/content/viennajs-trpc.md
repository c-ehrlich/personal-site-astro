I gave my first talk at a meetup this week, talking about tRPC at ViennaJS.

<p class="caption">...if you have, you might like tRPC</p>

Unfortunately due to a small misunderstanding there is no recording of this talk. I had initially planned to make my own recording in OBS, but when I saw that the presentations were being run through Streamyard I (incorrectly) assumed that there was going to be a VOD. Lesson learned, will double check with the organizers in the future.

You can find the slides and a collection of other related resources [here](/misc/trpc-viennajs).

Thanks to everyone who came, and I look forward to doing another one soon :)
