## ship, then stick around

when you ship a feature, most of the bugs will come in fast. week one, week two. it’s expected. the real problem is what you do with them.

because bugfixes, by default, make your code worse. they're patches. glue. workarounds.

by default, anyway.

because the people making them don’t have the full picture. they weren’t in the meetings. they didn’t see the tradeoffs. they don’t know which edge case was intentional and which was just “good enough to ship.” and they don’t have time to figure it out. they’re just trying to stop the bleeding.

so what happens? bandaids. fragile logic. duplicated code. “just in time” hacks that turn your clean system into a jenga tower.

and it didn’t have to be like that.

because when bugs show up, the code is still fresh in your head. you know what’s safe to delete. what you wish you’d written differently. what tech debt you didn’t quite have time to clean up before launch.

bugfixes are a gift. they’re a second chance to get it right. this is your chance to finish the work, not just patch it.

because if you disappear, someone else will fix it for you. and it won’t be an upgrade.

support your feature.
