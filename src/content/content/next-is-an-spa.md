New video about a common misconception that people have about Next.js. I found that this misunderstanding about where we are now makes it more difficult for people to understand why Server Components are so compelling, so I made this video to explain it.

<div class="video-container">
  <iframe
    width="100%"
    height="900px"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWRq1nRPUMs"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; 
    autoplay; 
    encrypted-media; 
    gyroscope; 
    picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
