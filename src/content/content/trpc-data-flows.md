Today I released my first educational YouTube video, "How tRPC really works".

It's aimed at people who have used tRPC before and want to level up their understanding of it. The video follows the data flow of a single query through the codebase from the frontend, to the procedure, and back to the frontend, and closely examines what happens at each stage.

Any feedback is appreciated. If you are interested in a written article version of this video, or in having it adapted into a talk for your meetup or conference, please get in touch :)

Here is a larger version of the diagram that I use in the video.
