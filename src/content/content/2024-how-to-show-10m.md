A few days ago I had the chance to speak at [Vendure](https://vendure.io/) conference about a type of frontend performance work I often do, about which there are not many resources online: Keeping an app performant while there are huge amounts of data.

The example I used is [Axiom](https://axiom.co/)'s trace viewer, which is able to load and render millions of spans without pagination.

Thanks for having me!
