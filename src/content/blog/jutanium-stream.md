Last night I appeared on the stream / YouTube channel of Dan Jutan aka [@jutanium](https://twitter.com/jutanium). We talked for almost two hours, covering:

- Approaches to teaching
- The value of documentation
- How to maintain the quality of documentation over time
- How to know if documentation is working, and which parts need improvement
- Why technical writers are undervalued
- tRPC and the huge surface area of its API

...and much more.

But more importantly, Dan gave me a review of the tRPC landing page and introductory docs. I am currently working on rewriting the "first 5 minutes" of the docs, so this was extremely valuable.

Thanks a lot to Dan for having me on and the docs review!
