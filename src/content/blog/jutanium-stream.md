## ðŸš¨ Disclaimer ðŸš¨

I'm returning to this post due to the recent [inacceptable](https://twitter.com/zeu_dev/status/1678935365699371010) [behaviour](https://twitter.com/devagrawal09/status/1679268841673707528) [by](https://twitter.com/crutchcorn/status/1679214679430922240) [Dan](https://twitter.com/LadyBluenotes/status/1679242965263454208).

I thought about deleting my original post entirely, but I believe it's important to acknowledge the situation, and make anyone who might watch the video on his channel aware of the situation. Therefore, I have chosen to leave the post unedited but provide this disclaimer to offer clarity.

When I appeared on Dan's stream, I knew him from his work on the Solid.js and Astro docs, and as someone who was just getting into technical writing and community management myself, I was eager to talk shop. Most of the bad stuff involving Dan hadn't happened yet, and the stuff that did already happen I simply wasn't aware of.

As someone who has faced personal struggles with mental health, I generally advocate for understanding and forgiveness when individuals exhibit harmful behavior. I have, in the past, acted poorly toward those I care about, and I am grateful for their willingness to accept my apologies once I regained clarity. I still hope Dan can get the help that he evidently needs.

However, it is crucial to acknowledge that Dan's behavior has crossed a line of unacceptability. Our primary concern should be the well-being of his victims.

I should have said this earlier, but at least I can say it now: I don't endorse any of Dan's behaviour, and I would recommend any project or person who is contacted by Dan to stay away from him. If you have been a victim of abuse or threats from Dan, or want to talk for any other reason, my DMs are always open.

## Original Post

Last night I appeared on the stream / YouTube channel of Dan Jutan aka [@jutanium](https://twitter.com/jutanium). We talked for almost two hours, covering:

- Approaches to teaching
- The value of documentation
- How to maintain the quality of documentation over time
- How to know if documentation is working, and which parts need improvement
- Why technical writers are undervalued
- tRPC and the huge surface area of its API

...and much more.

But more importantly, Dan gave me a review of the tRPC landing page and introductory docs. I am currently working on rewriting the "first 5 minutes" of the docs, so this was extremely valuable.

Thanks a lot to Dan for having me on and the docs review!
