Last night I had the immense privilege of being on the stream of Ryan Carniato, the creator of [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).

The first 2.5 hours are my conversation with Ryan, and then Ryan looks at React Server Components for about 1.5 hours, and the final hour is Ryan discussing recent news in the JavaScript ecosystem.

Topics include:

- Practicality and Abstraction in learning
- Ways to learn new technology
- Making content to answer questions and learn
- How I got involved with T3 OSS
- Advice on getting started with Open Source
- Using Create T3 App
- tRPC and the data flow
- tRPC and TanStack Query
- The balancing act between DX and bleeding edge

...and many more

I had a great time talking with Ryan and I'm really happy with how this turned out :)
