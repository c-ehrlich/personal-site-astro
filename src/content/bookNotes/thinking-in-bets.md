## Life is Poker, not Chess
* Winning and losing are only loose signals of decision quality
* "The implications of treating decisions as bets made it possible for me to find learning opportunities in uncertain environments."
* We are bad at estimating what ratio of "skill" and "luck" an outcome is based on
* "Trouble occurs when we treat real life decisions as if they were chess decisions. Chess contains no hidden information and very little luck."
* "getting comfortable with "I'm not sure" is a vital step to being a better decision-maker. We have to make peace with _not knowing_."
* "A great decision is the result of a good process, and that process must include an attempt to accurately represent our own state of knowledge."
* If we stop feeling good about winning, we can stop feeling bad about losing. This is a good trade-off. Don't fall for measuring yourself by outcomes!
* Protect "prefrontal cortex cycles" (decision making). You only have so much capacity each day.

## Wanna bet?
* "When you are betting, you have to back up your belief by putting a price on it." => try this execise for things that people don't usually bet on!
* Become aware when irrationality is keeping us from acting in our best interest.
* Everything is a bet - even stuff like parenting choices.
* Nice side-effect of treating decisions as bets: less lingering regret
* We bet based on what we believe about the world, so improving our model of the world is a high value activity - always calibrate your beliefs!
* "For survival-essential skills, type I errors (false positives) were more costly than type II errors (false negatives). In other words, better safe than sorry" => Find places where people make this mistake and gain an edge!
* Sometimes everyone is wrong about something for 25 years, for example low-fat diets
* We rarely challenge the validity of evidence that supports our case!
* "Wanna bet?" beings the risk out in the open, making explicit what is already implicit (and frequently overlooked)
* Train yourself to view the world through the lens of "Wanna bet?"
* For everything you say you believe, rank your confidence 0-10
* "Expressing our level of confidence also invites people to be our collaborators"

## Bet to Learn: Fielding the Unfolding Future
* Experiences can be a great teacher, but you have to let them (and figure out how luck/skill based something was)
* Learning to improve our model of the world makes us happier, richer, etc
* Identify self-serving bias! (a bit of impostor syndrome is healthy)
* "There are more than seven billion other people on the planet who do stuff all the time" - learn from them
* We like attributing our own victories to skill and those of others to luck
* Look for your mistakes when you're winning!
* "Instead of feeling bad when we have to admit a mistake, what if the bad feeling came from the thought that we might be missing a learning opportunity just to avoid blame?"
* "Always" and "never" are forbidden words
* ðŸš¨ Activity: "Why is <person x> successful? What are they doing that gets them there?

## The Buddy System
* Are you categorizing losses as a series of things "happening to you"?
* Form a bet-making / truth-seeking group, others can spot your errors easier!
* "Two to disagree, and one to referee"
* Encourage people to disagree politely, and try to steelman each others viewpoints
* "Calibration requires an open-minded consideration of diverse points of view and alternative hypotheses"
* "I don't want to hear it. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, but if you have a question about a hand, you can ask me about strategy all day long. I just don't think there's much purpose in a poker story if the point is about something you had no control over, like bad luck."
* People care STRONGLY about audience approval in almost all situations
* View evidence that contradicts your view as helpful, not hurtful
* Red team your own views

## Dissent to win
* "As a rule of thumb, if we have an urge to leave out a detail because it makes us uncomfortable or requires even more clarification to explain away, those are exactly the details we must share"
* We tend to overvalue the messenger and undervalue the message - how would you feel about this if you heard it from a different source?
* Omit the outcome when asking for advice on a play (in poker, but also elsewhere)
* Examine the level of confidence in your opinions
* We don't usually examine critically evidence that supports our view
* ðŸš¨ Ask for an agreement to engage in truth-seeking. Sometimes people just want to vent - "Do you want to just let it all out, or are you thinking about what to do next?"
* "How might you get rid of all these things that are happening to you (pretend it's luck) in the future?"
* Always focus on the future when doing this with people who aren't in on truth-seeking

## Adventures in mental time travel
* To kids: "It must be hard to have a teacher like that. Do you think there's anything you can do to improve your grade in the future?"
* Think about the future version of you that has to live with a decision!
* ðŸš¨ What are the consequences of each of my options in ten minutes? In ten months? In ten years?
* We tend to overvalue our current emotion (flat tire feels like the end of the world)
* Like looking at a 5 minute window in a stock ticker... tells us NOTHING about long term
* "It's all just one long poker game"
* We can't ever know the EV of an action, but it's worth thinking about nonetheless
* ðŸš¨ Activity: assign EV to every bet. Like actually do it. Will take you away from doing 0%/100%
* What is the EV of my freelance gigs, moonshot projects, CFPs, etc?
* Backcasting: working backwards from a positive future
* Premortems: working backwards from a negative future
* ðŸš¨ Activity: do Backcasting and Premortems for life, work, love, etc
  * a situation where Satsuki and I are happily married...
  * "Okay, we failed. Why did we fail?"
