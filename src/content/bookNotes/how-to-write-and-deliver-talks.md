## Preparing A Talk
- Good talks: empathy, motivation, fun (or super deep technical stuff)
- Bad talks: sales pitch
- Server your listeners
  - "Make sure you make it clear -- near the start -- how your listeners are going to benefit"
  - Example: "Looking at it this way makes me enjoy my job more, level up as a developer, etc."
- Make it about your personal experience (most of the time)
- Learn as much as possible beforehand, only talk about the first 20%
- "Start with paper, not slides" - ideas, topics, structures... thinking of one individual impactful slide is ok
- Choose a suitable structure
  - Question (pose it explicitly) - answer
  - Thesis - supported/proven/explained
  - Problem - solution
  - Need or desire - fulfilment (best for sales pitch)
  - Story - lesson or conclusion (can be a subsection of a larger talk)
  - Statement/description - examples
    - Similar to thesis, but for "self-evident" things
- ðŸš¨ Rehearse out loud!!!
  - but remember that the buzz in the room will give you more energy than at home
    - remember my Edge joke... get people on your side
- It's virtually impossible for an audience to read and listen at the same time
- Prepare light and dark mode slides, and choose in the moment
- ðŸš¨ Practice with a stopwatch so that you know where in the talk you should be at ten-minute checkpoints. And write the checkpoints into your notes
- Talks generally take a bit shorter than practice runs because of nervousness
- Props... cs50 phone book
- Signposting feels corny but works really well! "That's it for the first section. Now I'd like to move on to the second section, which is ..."
- Be relatable
  - Assume that there are people in the audience who could give your talk just as well as you can, and also people who may never have heard or thought about the ideas I'm presenting
- Repeat key ideas!
- Keep your pace slow and clear without being monotone
- Vary pitch, tone, and pace in a way that emphasizes your point
- Be enthusiastic!

## Delivering a talk
- Cut out two-thirds of your introduction
- Hook, then intro
- Some of the best openings are last-minute ad-libs about something that happened
- Audience participation is cool! Make people talk to each other
- Performance personality
  - expert
  - cheerleader
  - facilitator
  - storyteller
  - coordinator
  - inventor
  - each person is some % of these, but also vary it by talk
- Talking from memory is better than a teleprompter
  - but writing down a few key bits is ok
- Treat all questions as though they are sincere (but keep control)
- Being a bit nervous is ok. Everyone loves Jenny from Stately
- Strike "power poses" before going out
- Breathe!
- If things are truly falling apart, the audience will give you time to collect yourslef - they're on your side!

## Improving your game
- Present as often as possible - meetups
- Don't be thrown off if you make a mistake. Just correct it. "Sorry, I think a stumbled a bit earlier. Just to be clear, XYZ"
- Consider getting some training (voice coach etc - expense it)

## Checklist
- The audience is clearly defined
- The talk appropriately balances the practical and the academic
- I've taken responsibility for how commercial the talk is
- The visuals support the talk, and don't include too much test
- I've developed an appropriate presenter style that I'm reasonably comfortable with
- I've rehearsed the talk multiple times, in front of a camera
- The talk includes something for the audience to take away, e.g. a Monday morning activity (explicit!)
