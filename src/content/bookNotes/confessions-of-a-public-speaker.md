## I can't see you naked
* The secret to coping with these events is to realize everyone forgets about them after they happen--except for one person: me. No one else really cares that much.
* Even the best speakers make tons of mistakes
* Never plan to use the full time given
* It's the mistakes you make before you even say a word that matter more. These include the mistakes of not having an interesting opinion, of not thinking clearly about your points, and of not planning ways to make those points relevant to your audience. Those are the ones that make the difference.

## The attack of the butterflies
* the only difference between the pros and the novices is that the pros have trained the butterflies to fly in formation
* the body's reaction to fear and excitement is the same...so it becomes a mental decision: am I afraid or am I excited?
* My intent is simply to know my material so well that I'm very comfortable iwth it
* I'm not a better public speaker than anyone else--I'm just better at catching and fixing problems.
* I repeat (rehearsing) until I can get through the entire talk without making makor mistakes.
* Pay close attention the next time you're listening to a good public speaker. The speaker is probably natural and comfortable, making you feel as though he's talking to a small group, despite how many people are actually in the audience.

## How to work a touch room
* the only trick is to start, as fear comes from what you imagine what might happen instead of what actually is happening, and the longer you wait the worse it gets.
* Ask people to move to the front of the room if it's a small audience
  * "Who has exercised this morning... all right I'll help you. I need everyone to stand up, and move to the closest possible seat in the front of the room"
* own your turf - ask if the crowd is warm or cold, ask organizer to fix it
* pick up on points and jokes from the previous talk
* You have to embody what you want the audience to be. If you want them to have fun, you need to have fun.
* Show some integrity by speaking the truth to the very thing that angers the audience, or even acknowledging it in a heartfelt way, and you will score points.
* Find strongest opponents, talk to them beforehand, during talk" here are the top complaints I heard from talking to X, Y, Z"

## Do not eat the microphone
* All good public speaking is based on good private thinking - refine rough ideas into clear ones
* People come to talks for different reasons
  1. Want to learn something
  2. Wish to be inspired
  3. Hope to be entertained
  4. Have a need they hope you will satisfy
  5. Desire to meet other people interested in the subject
  6. Seek a positive experience they can share with others
  7. Are forced to be there by bosses, parents, etc
  => A great talk nails the first six and ends early
* How to get there
  * Think a lot beforehand
  * Have a strong position (in the title)
  * Think carefully about your specific audience
  * Make your specific points as concise as possible (one sentence)
  * Know the likely counterarguments from an intelligent audience
* "If you only had one single point, what would it be? That's what your title should communicate"
* ðŸš¨ Good lectures are never comprehensive
* Good title: "How to be creative in doing boring work"
  * "The top five problems you have with <thing> and how to solve them
  * Why <thing> sucks and what we can do about it
  * Mistakes I made in <doing thing> and what I learned
  * Smart shortcuts and clever tricks only experts know about <thing>
* Make a list of points (20+), show to people, figure out what's important

## Photos you don't expect to see
* "Travel, however, is excellend for finding new questions to ask, so I write often while on trips."
* "sit in the cheap seats before your talk to remind yourself of how much energy you need to project so that you don't look like a zombie on stage"

## The science of not boring people
* Never spend more than 10 minutes on a single point, and make sure each point is interesting
* "Once you have everyone's attention, briefly outline how (the talk) will work"
* "Start with a beat. Think of your opening minute as a movie preview: fill it with drama, excitement, and highlights for why people should keep listening."

## How to give a good talk
* Tell stories!
  * An audience that is hooked on a story will follow you anywhere
  * "Influence is a function of grabbing someone's attention, connecting to what they already feel is important, and linking that feeling to whatever you want them to see, do, or feel"
* Charisma
  * ðŸš¨ "be bigger than you are. Speak louder, take stronger positions, and behave more aggressively than you would in an ordinary conversation. These are the rules of performing"
  * "be a passionate, interested, fully present version of you"
  * the bigger the audience, the bigger you need to be
* Get the audience involved
  * show of hands
  * give them a problem to solve
* Determine the pace
* End early

## lessons from my 15 minutes of fame
* The secret to speaking on camera is to pretend you're speaking to a small group of friends

## The things people say
* It's hard to get good feedback on talks!
* Appearing credible is a learned skill
  * Not necessarily about substance
  * Host can help give a speaker credibility
  * Superficials (appearance, posture, etc) matter
  * A good comedian who knows nothing about a subject matter would probably be more liked than many professors
  * Enthusiasm matters - always give significant energy!
* ðŸš¨ Feedback you should ask for
  * How did my presentation compare to others?
  * What one change would have most improved my presentation?
  * What questions did you expect me to answer that went unanswered?
  * What annoyances did I let get in the way of giving you what you need?
* Turn "great job!" into "thanks, how can I make it even better?"
* Ask the host, "what effect do you want me to have on this audience?"
* ðŸš¨ More good questions
  * Was this a good use of your time?
  * Would you recommend this lecture to others?
  * Are you considering doing anything different as a result of this talk?
  * Do you know what to do next to continue learning?
  * Were you inspired or motivated?
  * How likeable did you find the speaker?
  * How substantive did you find the speaker's material?
* ðŸš¨ RECORD YOURSELF - "If you're too scared ot watch yourself speak, how can you expect your audience to watch you?"

## The clutch is your friend
* One-on-one is best
* You can't teach 5000 people equally
* Make it active and interesting, start with insights that interest the students, keep adapting to get better at 1 and 2

## Confessions
* "Sometimes people at my talks know much of what I know. In these cases, my value is to remind them of an old idea or put it into a new context"
* ðŸš¨ PRACTICE!!!
* "If I see a good speaker, I usually prefer to go and read his blog or buy his book than sit and listen to his entire talk. I'd prefer to buy him coffee or exchange email, where the communication is two ways. If I can't do that, I'd rather go out into the hallway and have a conversation with someone else."
* ðŸš¨ "If I have any secret to being entertaining, it's that I studied improv theater. There I learned how to see and how to listen. Humor and insight come from paying attention, not from special talents."
* The feedback most speakers need is "be more honest".

## The little things pros do
* Give stuff away to fill the front row
* Treat your cameramen well, and ask them for advice

## How to make a point
* Don't speak in monotone! Place emphasis on certain words!
* Don't be afraid of silence! It's better than ummm sooo

## When things go wrong
* You have more power than any heckler!
* The audience hates people who love to hear themselves talk! Shut them down early!
* Learn to say "I don't know"
  * Offer those questions to the audience
* If you need filler material during tech problems, ask people more questions
* Have a printout of your slides with you. In the worst case, they're your notes.
* Plan to save 20-30% of your time slot for Q&A
* If your audience is for 5 people, don't pretend they're 100 people. Instead scrap most of the talk, get them in a circle, and chat.
