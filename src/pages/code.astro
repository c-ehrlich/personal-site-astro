          <strong><a href="https://www.axiom.co/">Axiom</a></strong> is creating
          a next-generation observability platform at a fraction of the cost of competitors
          like Splunk and Datadog. My main purpose is empowering the frontend team
          to ship faster and with more confidence. This has involved upgrading to
          a modern stack, large scale refactorings to reduce complexity, improving
          CI, and creating a test harness. I have also shipped end-to-end features,
          and work on the open source SDKs, especially around JavaScript / NextJS
          / tRPC.

          <strong><a href="https://create.t3.gg">Create T3 App</a></strong> (20k
          ðŸŒŸ) is the best way to start a full-stack, typesafe Next.js app with outstanding
          DX. As a member of the core team I work on the tool and its future direction,
          do community outreach to get contributions (we have over 200 contributors
          including maintainers of Next.js, vue, eslint, and others), and lead the
          documentation and translation effort.

          <strong><a href="https://trpc.io/">tRPC</a></strong> (30k ðŸŒŸ) is a tool
          for creating end-to-end typesafe APIs. I have done some small contributions
          to the codebase, but my main contribution has been rewriting the docs to
          make them more welcoming and accessible to new users.

          I shipped features that covered a sprawling codebase, upgraded the frontend
          tech stack, and trained other developers.

          </strong> is a tool that helps language learners determine which words
          are most useful to learn next by combining immersion and frequency lists.
          Initially created just for myself to help me pass the <a

          a few friends on Discord, it is now used by dozens of language learners
          every day.
