        <strong><a href="https://www.axiom.co/">Axiom</a></strong> is a next-generation
        observability platform at a fraction of the cost of competitors like Splunk
        and Datadog. My role is to empower the frontend team to ship faster and with
        more confidence. I also maintain several SDKs.

        <strong><a href="https://trpc.io/">tRPC</a></strong> (35k ðŸŒŸ) is a tool for
        creating end-to-end typesafe APIs. I occasionally contribute to the codebase,
        but my main focus has been creating educational content and rewriting the
        docs to make them more welcoming and accessible to new users.

        is the best way to start a full-stack, typesafe Next.js app with first-class
        DX. As a member of the core team I work on all aspects of the project and
        its future direction.

        for managing i18n, modernised the frontend tech stack, and upskilled other
        developers.

        <strong><a href="https://catmash.c-ehrlich.dev/">Catmash</a></strong> is
        a game where you and your friends can vote on cats. I built this as a fun
        activity for the team meetings at Axiom. It uses the Partykit runtime and
        was included in <a

        of a service that shall not be named, was unfortunately taken down without
        warning. I'll spin this back up one of these days.

        </strong> is a from-first-principles toolchain for building web apps. The
        goal is to build everything from scratch, to learn about how the real stuff
        works. So far I've built a React-like rendering framework with concurrent
        rendering / reconciliation and a Babel plugin for parsing a subset of JSX.
        Future ideas include a router, data fetching / network state library, bundler,
        test runner, package manager, monorepo tooling, etc.

        dozens of language learners every day.
